Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
Description
For this challenge, I was asked to create a timed, multiple choice, coding-themed quiz application that can store high scores.

This application runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It is also easy to navigate, with a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over

Intial HTML before any CSS or JavaScript are added to it.
